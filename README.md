### This web app:

Dynamically displays up to date NFL game information from the past 7 days (week) in the form of a dashboard with team name and conference dynamic filtering. Includes summary statistics for the finished games and chart visualizations. Additonally, a new detail view was developed to view more details about each game and players and allow for more navigation through the site!
